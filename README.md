# Tic_Tac_Toe-CPP
Tic Tac Toe game with the basic win prevention feature .

(I repeated a few lines of code .Forgive me)

The program basically contains 5 functions.
1->The smartcomp function searches for a user win situation and blocks the pattern
from being completed.

2->The WinCheck function checks and produces the result of the game.

3->The choice function gives the user the ability to choose a his/her preferred marker.

4->The game function controls the flow of the game (takes input and calls different functions 
to operate on the multidimensional array) 

5->Basic Menu function containing a switch case statement.

The project is lengthy and some of the inner details of code are not really necessary to complete the project.
I didnt really concentrate on code readability . So, I hope you still understood my thinking.
